How did we learn to listen, and how do we continue to work the edges of our listening?

Chaplain training programs are effectively paused, including the Zen-based chaplaincy program where I’m a student. We’re re-imagining how to proceed, given coronavirus, through the opposing forces of sheltered-in-place boredom, on the one hand, and indiscriminate death-by-pneumonia, on the other. Is the chaplain, let alone the chaplain intern, an “essential employee?” What are we to do with ourselves?

For my part, I hope to use this moment of tension and uncertainty as an opportunity to grind my own axe and nudge our practice further out of sentimentality and into the imagination.

Because imagination, certainly, is at the heart both of chaplaincy and of Zen. It’s not all breathwork and ceasing from delusion. There is quite a lot to be said on behalf of the humble delusion--the true delusion--the right delusion for the right person at the right time.

The pantheon of Zen overflows with creatures we can hardly imagine: ancestors, dragons, protector deities, snake people and ghosts, lion thrones and lotus worlds. It’s a menagerie of imports from large swathes of the world scene. Of particular importance are the bodhisattvas, from Sanskrit meaning ‘awakening beings’. Traditionally, a bodhisattva is thought to be a creature living out its penultimate life. They’ve been a student of the Way for some time, and they’re pretty liberated. They dwell on a cusp. Next time around, they’ll get it, but for now, they’re getting there. You and I, being in processes of awakening, are awakening beings, bodhisattvas.

Particularly beloved is the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, “she who hears the cries of the world.” Chaplains in our school are often inspired by her salvific vision, by her sensitivity, and by her universal receptivity. She is sometimes imagined as having many hands, where each hand holds just what is needed in a situation: maybe it’s a flower, a spatula, a glass of cool water, a rare medicine, some money, a gesture, a pack of gum.

We chaplains imagine ourselves as her, or as channeling her, or else maybe as tuning in to her frequency. In any case, we bear some kind of relationship to her, and we are each tasked with locating her--locating compassion--in a moment, somewhere in the matrix of ourselves.

Does Avalokitesvara listen with her ears? I believe we already know the answer: not quite. That would be far too one-dimensional. For all we know, “she who hears the cries of the world” is as deaf as Beethoven, because her main practice is embodied, soulful listening. She listens with heart and with belly. She picks up reverberating lows. She takes in--and takes on--entire situations, hears in imagery painted through time, hears action and potential.

Of course, we shouldn’t make an idol of listening. We all already know that we need a higher EQ, that we need the right apps and the right podcasts, that good leaders listen, and that we really should be meditating more, unless it is our partner or our parents or our children who really should be meditating more. This is all thoroughly in the culture already or at least in a growing sector of it. And yet hearing, for those of us not deaf from birth, may well be our first sense to come online. We hear-feel our mother’s heartbeat, and we hear-feel the reverberations of her voice. Listening--taken not as ear-bound--is universal. Above all, it is natural. It is of nature.

There’s an old Buddhist story about how Avalokitesvara got her many hands. One day, A. grew tired of helping so many suffering beings. They just kept coming, infinite such as they are. In time, the awakening being grew overwhelmed by the weight of her vow to attend to them all. She grew so disheartened and so worked up that her head literally, as it were, exploded. Fortunately, the Buddha saw this, and tenderly, he reconstituted her. Avalokitesvara’s head was pieced back together, and she was given one thousand new arms. Each of her one thousand hands had, at the very center of its palm, an eye. In this way, her compassion would be discerning and wise, in addition to all-encompassing.

Avalokitesvara herself had, at some crucial juncture, to go to pieces and to rely on a friend for help. She is furthermore unveiled here as keen and faceted, able to get a grip, synesthetic, suffused by touch. As they say, “you don’t need your eyes to feel. Just watch me, watch me, watch me, with your hands.”

Actually, that last line is off the 2018 pop song “Imaginary Friend” by Danish singer-songwriter MØ, and this brings us to the crux of the essay. How do we learn to listen like Avalokitesvara? How, or where, do we learn to delight in her mode of expansive listening? I do not doubt that there are many ways, but one way is through music, and this brings us to the matter of pop music and the matter of the playlist (or anachronistically, the mixtape).

First, call to mind a person. It could be you. In fact, let’s just call them you. In any case, I am writing this for you, and I hereby dedicate it to you and to your favorite adolescent activity: you are in your room, or you are in your car, or you are on the subway with airpods, and you are repeating the same songs--over and over and over and over--having a full-blown experience, right on the edge of consciousness. You are stewing, and you are crystalizing an emotion--desire, maybe; grief, maybe. Your eternal puberty brain just can’t seem to get enough. You are repeating, not as compulsion, but as practice. You are, or will be, a master of exactly this kind of thing.

Turn now to the humble mixtape. You are making it for your friend or your crush. You are selecting and ordering. You are obsessed--obsessed!--with what it could mean that track 4 talks about love. Track 4 is blatantly a love song. You are curating an experience, and you are smudging the distinction between creation and consumption. You are now listening to track 2 together. You are severely monitoring their face for, okay, really, at this point, any kind of response would do, and look, the song gets much better about halfway through, you swear.

This is totally fundamental, totally shared, totally at the center of how many of us learned to relate and to feel. I don’t know what an archetype is, but let’s just go ahead and claim it--“repeating the song” and “curating the mixtape”--could there be any doubt that such activities are of an archetypal nature? What are we doing when we do these things? Whence the urge to electrify that old social network, which links cicadas and chanting, birdsong and liturgy, connecting mating ritual, confessional, Charli XCX, and more? Well, I suppose, why not?

Why, in any case, is music neglected in the training of professional listeners? As it is, it is left to history or to chance that someone working to become a chaplain or a therapist has a sense of harmony, of rhythm, of tempo. I do not wish to suggest policy or dispute style, but the silence is curious.

The first reason why music is good training for the kind of listening we do in the helping professions is practical. It is often hard to hear the singer through the band, just as it is often hard to hear the patient through the commotion of the hospital.

The second reason why music is good training for listening is that it is cross-cultural and cross-generational. We cultivate our own aesthetic response, and at the same time, learn to love or to tolerate an oldie, Mongolian throat singing, country trap, or whatever it is the kids these days are into. The hatred of any kind of music--not unlike the hatred of small animals--speaks volumes, and the hatred of popular music is perhaps the most telling prejudice of all.

The third reason why music is good training is that it is one of the few places where the culture permits and even encourages us to be symbolic. To take an essentially random example, Leon Bridges sings, 

> I give up, I'm in love cryin' out to you  
> O me o my I can't explain  
> She might just be my everything.  

We can wonder about this undirected ‘you’ -- is it his beloved, a confidant, you the listener, God? In a sense, everything points back to Leon. Everything is a part of the whole that is the song: Leon is giving up; Leon is crying out; he is listening from both sides; he is imagining her; and she is not just she, she also stands in for some part of Leon’s own self that is longed for, enticing, offstage. The song, as a dream, expresses itself in its totality. People do this too. Hence, it is good for listening practice.

It may not be the point of music, but can we imagine a more equal dialogue with our songs? When an artist cries out, is it too literal, too knee-jerk, or too self-important to hazard a reply? How might that go?

Perhaps it would go like this. Pick any song, even an instrumental. This should be practiced in the fold of a devoted peer group. No response is wrong. This is exploration, and this is for you.

You put on the song. It turns out it’s “Sorry” by Justin Bieber, and the chaplain training continues, from the confines of quarantine.

> I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice  
> So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight  
> 'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances  
> Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?  
> 'Cause I'm missing more than just your body

Regret, obstinacy, body, plea; body, *corpus christi*, apology, second chance, redemption, rebirth.

Now pause the track and take turns, attuning, counseling, and being moved by the Biebs and his struggle. How might you respond? Get on a first name basis, if it feels right. Don’t leave Justin hanging.
 
“What else are you missing?”

“How could it be too late?”
